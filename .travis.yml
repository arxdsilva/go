# We expect users to use something fairly recent so we test the last two
# versions plus tip.  Update these freely as new versions of Go are released.

# We choose two versions since official support of Go mirrors this policy:
# Only the current major release (x.y) has full official support.
# The previous major release gets security-only support.
#
# Tip is useful to automatically test a version more recent than the
# the last time .travis.yml was looked at, and (unlikely as it might be)
# to alert us to any real upcoming change in the language that would be
# incompatible with our existing code.
#
# We used to test additional versions beyond the last two,
# but since Travis only runs five jobs at a time throughout all of Exercism,
# it is better citizenship to not test the additional versions.

# Travis runs in a 64 bit environment but beginning with Go 1.5, building a
# 32 bit target is as easy as specifying GOARCH.  We test both to accommodate
# users that might be running 32 bit environments and make sure our code
# works for them.
#
# Race detection is valuable for our problems that involve concurrency.
# The race detector isn't supported on 386 though.
